\section{Introduction}
This project aims to understand the impact of lifestyle and health factors on sleep quality and disorders.
\newline This project compiles data including metrics related to sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, stress levels, BMI categories, blood pressure, heart rate, and daily steps. We aim to use data visualization and statistical analysis methods to investigate the variables that significantly affect sleep health. Preliminary analysis may reveal insights such as the correlation between physical activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, but the project will also explore more complex relationships and potential predictors of sleep disorders.
\newline The rest of the report is organized as follows: section 2 provides a background on the importance of sleep health and its relationship with lifestyle factors, section 3 presents the research question and problem statement that the report aims to answer, section 4 discusses the data used in this project, its sources, and provides a brief overview of the contents of each dataset, section 5 analyzes those datasets and offers a statistical view of the data, section 6 presents the findings of the project, section 7 discusses the implications of these findings and their potential applications, and section 8 concludes the report with a summary of the key insights and suggestions for future research.


\section{Background}
A. Impact of Occupational Hazards and Lifestyle on Sleep Quality In high-risk professions, such as those of long-distance
heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers, the interplay of demanding work schedules and suboptimal lifestyle choices is a critical concern. This demographic is notably susceptible to a range of health challenges, including increased risks of chronic diseases and reduced life expectancy, largely attributed to inadequate sleep, which is further linked to a higher risk of accidents [2]. Additionally, professions with an aging workforce show a decline in sleep efficiency and duration as age increases, leading to significant health concerns [3].

B. Influence of Professional Demands on Sleep Patterns Athletes face unique challenges in maintaining optimal
sleep due to factors such as erratic training and competition schedules, frequent travel, and psychological stress. These, combined with the consumption of stimulants like caffeine, contribute to substantial variations in sleep patterns, impacting sleep onset and offset times [1]. Elite athletes, in particular, experience a profound influence on sleep regularity due to external factors like rigorous training schedules and psychological stress, despite the stability of the biological bases of
sleep [4].

C. The Importance of Regular Sleep Patterns The key to sleep efficiency is establishing regular sleep
patterns, especially consistency in sleep onset and offset times. However, achieving this regularity is often challenged by varying professional and personal commitments, particularly in careers with irregular hours or high stress [2].

D. Analyzing Sleep Health and Efficiency Through Data An in-depth analysis of the ”Sleep Health” and ”Sleep Effi-
ciency” datasets reveals significant insights into the multifactorial nature of sleep quality and disorders. These datasets highlight the impact of factors such as occupational stress, physical activity, BMI, heart rate, and lifestyle elements like caffeine and alcohol consumption on sleep. The research demonstrates the crucial role of sleep quality, duration, efficiency, and stages in overall health and the necessity for lifestyle modifications and targeted interventions for the accurate prediction and
improvement of sleep disorders [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].


\section{Research Question and Problem Statement}

Can machine learning models effectively identify key lifestyle and health factors influencing sleep quality and having sleep disorder?

Understanding the intricate relationship between various lifestyle and health factors and their impact on sleep quality and disorders is essential for developing effective health interventions. Traditional analytical methods may not fully capture the complex interactions and nonlinear relationships between these factors. This research aims to leverage the capabilities of machine learning models to analyze a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic, occupational, physical activity, stress levels, and health indicators. The objective is to determine how these factors collectively influence sleep duration, quality, and the presence of sleep disorders. By evaluating the performance of various machine learning models, this study seeks to pinpoint the most significant factors affecting sleep health. The insights gained could provide valuable guidance for healthcare professionals and policymakers in formulating strategies to enhance sleep quality and address sleep-related issues in the population.

## Predictor Variables

Predictor variables include 'Gender', 'Age', 'Occupation', 'Physical Activity Level', 'Stress Level', 'Quality of Sleep', 'BMI Category', and 'Daily Steps'.

These variables are measured through surveys or collected data from individuals health records
The distribution of each predictor will be presented using descriptive statistics and visualizations. 

Descriptive statistics for each variable:
```{r echo=FALSE}

# Calculating Descriptive Statistics
descriptive_stats <- Sleep_dataset %>%
  summarise(across(c(Age, Sleep.Duration, Quality.of.Sleep, Physical.Activity.Level, 
                     Stress.Level, Blood.Pressure.1, Blood.Pressure.2, 
                     Heart.Rate, Daily.Steps, BMI.Levels),
                   list(mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), 
                        sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE),
                        min = ~min(., na.rm = TRUE),
                        max = ~max(., na.rm = TRUE)))) 

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Create a data frame with the provided statistics
statistics <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Age", "Quality of Sleep", "Physical Activity Level", "Stress Level",
               "Daily Steps", "BMI Levels", "Blood Pressure 1", "Blood Pressure 2",
               "Heart Rate", "Sleep Duration"),
  Mean = c(42, 7, 59, 5, 6816, 1, 128, 84, 70, 7.1),
  Standard_Deviation = c(8, 1, 20, 1, 1617, 0.5, 7, 6, 4, 0.79),
  Range = c("27 to 59", "4 to 9", "30 to 90", "3 to 8", "3000 to 10000", "1 to 3",
            "115 to 142", "75 to 95", "65 to 86", "5.8 to 8.5")

## Potential Issues with the Data 

When considering potential issues with the data, the primary concerns are the lack of variation in some categories and potential biases. For instance, certain occupations or BMI categories might have limited representation, which could affect the generalizability of the findings. Also, if the sample is not representative of the broader population (e.g., skewed towards a specific age group, or occupational category), it could introduce biases in the analysis.

## Solutions to the issues
 To overcome or mitigate the issues of lack of variation and potential biases in your data analysis, a multifaceted approach can be adopted. Firstly, it's essential to transparently report the limitations of the study due to these factors. Acknowledging the specific areas where the dataset may not perfectly represent the broader population or where certain categories are underrepresented adds to the credibility of the research and aids in the accurate interpretation of the results. Alongside this, the implementation of regression techniques serves as a robust method to address imbalances in the dataset. By using logistic or linear regression models, it becomes possible to control for confounding variables, allowing for a more accurate isolation of the effects of primary predictors. This approach not only helps in drawing more reliable conclusions but also enhances the overall integrity of the analysis by systematically adjusting for known dataset limitations.
